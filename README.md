# Lily's Personal Portfolio

## Description
As the final project for Digital Product Management, this website serves as a personal portfolio to showcase my work and strengthen my personal brand. It includes an About Me, Contact, and Portfolio section. I would like to expand the website to include more of my experiences such as personal and creative work.
